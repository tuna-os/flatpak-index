# Contributing to flatpak-index

Thank you for your work on the TunaOS Flatpak index. This repository holds
scripts, templates, and CI actions to build and audit the Flatpak remote.
[`README.md`](README.md) is the user guide.

[`tuna-os/docs`](https://github.com/tuna-os/docs) owns the canonical Flatpak
catalog at `static/flatpak/index/static`. The Worker for `tunaos.org` serves
the live index. See the README section on canonical catalog ownership for details.
The [runbook for the application lifecycle](docs/APP-LIFECYCLE.md) explains how contributors add, update, pause, and retire an application.

## Contribute compute — no code needed

**[Donate time with your AI CLI](https://hub.tunaos.org/#contribute).**

Your machine runs one task at a time using your signed-in AI coding CLI.
The relay alternates between eligible **School** (OS) and **Reef** (apps)
hives after each task. If one hive has no work, the other can continue.

The guide covers prerequisites, verified `just` setup, credentials, provider
costs, and how to stop with Ctrl+C. Your subscription quota or API charges apply.
Never post account credentials or API keys in issues or pull requests.

## Repository layout

| Path | What lives here |
|---|---|
| `scripts/update-index.py` | Standalone, self-contained implementation that adds/replaces one app's entry in an OCI index. The organization's preferred canonical path is the [`update-flatpak-index` composite action](https://github.com/tuna-os/.github/tree/main/.github/actions/update-flatpak-index); application repos should prefer it. If a repo vendors this script at `.github/scripts/update-index.py`, see the README's "How to add a new Flatpak" section before changing its interface. |
| `scripts/enrich-index.py` | Re-reads AppStream labels from the registry and repairs/audits an index file in place (missing metadata, missing screenshots). |
| `scripts/oci.py` | Shared OCI layout/registry helpers used by the other scripts. |
| `.github/actions/capture-screenshots` | Composite action that captures an app's own window under a headless X server for AppStream screenshots; see `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md`. |
| `templates/` | Starting points for new app metainfo files; see `docs/METAINFO.md`. |
| `tests/` | `unittest`-based test suite for the scripts above. |

## Development

You need Python 3.11+ and the standard library only — no extra dependencies
to install.

Run the test suite locally:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Audit the live remote index against what the registry publishes (this
check needs no local setup beyond `curl`):

```bash
curl -sSfL -o served-index.json https://tunaos.org/flatpak/index/static
./scripts/enrich-index.py served-index.json --check
```

## Making a change

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Keep `scripts/update-index.py` self-contained (one file, standard library
   only). Application repos vendor it directly; a new dependency or file split
   breaks every consumer.
3. If you change the CLI contract for `update-index.py` or `enrich-index.py`,
   check the docs. Update the README, `docs/METAINFO.md`, and
   `docs/SCREENSHOTS.md` if needed.
4. Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` before you open a PR; add
   or extend tests under `tests/` for any behavior change.
5. Open a PR that describes what changed and why, and link any related issue.

Changes to the production index (`static/flatpak/index/static`) belong in
`tuna-os/docs` or in the publish workflow of the target application
repository. Do not change it here; see the README section on canonical catalog ownership.
Rollback of production entries belongs to `tuna-os/docs`.
